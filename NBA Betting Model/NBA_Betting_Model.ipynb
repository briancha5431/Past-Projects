    "### **VISION** \n",
    "The idea we would like to try to present is a working (although may not be completely accurate) NBA betting model that allows users to get a better chance of winning their bet. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal, big picture conclusion would be to reveal a model/picture of some sort that portrays the evidence and numbers that show the user which team to bet on when placing their bets. In our case, we will be using a linear regression model!\n",
    "\n",
    "A reasonable final milestone for our project would be the make sure the model works to our intent and provide some example bets (since the NBA season and summer league have come to a close). If we have time, we would also like to add additional features... for now we only used the team's SRS values, which are the best singular attribute to use when comparing teams."

    "Note: The SRS is a statistic that is calculated by the Web Developers of Basketball Reference... By their definition, the SRS is the \"Simple Rating System: a team rating that takes into account average point differential [how much the team wins by in points] and strength of schedule [the opponents they face]. The rating is denominated in points above/below average, where zero is the average.\""

    "### **Progress**\n",
    "Pandas, numpy arrays, and matplotlib for our linear regression model has been able to work so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are able to manipulate the data so we can alter our dataframe, and then use the information from our df to create a linear regression model. We then used the equation given from our walkthrough to calculate which team to bet on in a certain game of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't actually tested the numbers out since there are no games occurring at the moment. However, I think we can create non-biased, random betting odds to see if our model works. We can essentially pretend that there are games occurring. Using our logic (as NBA Fans), we can determine if those odds are accurate or not. Personally, I believe that the next steps are straightforward. We will test out our model with several example cases and see if we add other statistics outside of the SRS to make our model as accurate as possible. "

    "Throughout the past few days (weeks), we have changed our approach to tackle our goal, but our overall goal hasn't changed. We still want to develop an accurate NBA betting model. However, we have switched from using APIs to local dataframes and linear regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to test our model using betting odds from previous seasons to see if they work out. Obviously, we cannot use current season bettings because the season came to a close.\n",

    "We have figured out ways to adapt to certain changes by exploring different ways to fulfill our goal. We have looked at walkthroughs and previous assignments to get inspiration on how to maneveur around such challenges. \n",
